# Fast Kill Plugin

This unofficial TaleSpire plugin that allows you to delete minis and converted props using a key or key combination instead
of using the confirmation style radial menu. With the ability to use Undo, mapping the removal of minis/props to a single
key like delete or backspace provides the quickest way to remove such assets but if you have concerns you can map the remove
function to a more unique combination, such as the default (RCTRL+DELETE), to avoid accidental removal.
